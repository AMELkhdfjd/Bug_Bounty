## Scope Discovery

whois // to have more infos about a domain name

reverse whois // to find all the domains that belong to the same owner, tool like ViewDNS.info

## Certificate Parsing
to find hostnames that use the same ssl certificate

## Subdomain Enumeration

to have wordlists for domains https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/

A good tool for automating the process is Altdns (https://github.com/infosec-au/altdns/), which discovers subdomains with names that are permutations of other subdomain names.

Next, find subdomains of subdomains by running the enumeration tools on the previous results

## Service Enumeration

with nmap =====> active scanning (attackers can be detected)
shodan, Censys and Project Sonar =====> passive scanning (no detection)
