## Scope Discovery

whois // to have more infos about a domain name

reverse whois // to find all the domains that belong to the same owner, tool like ViewDNS.info

## Certificate Parsing
to find hostnames that use the same ssl certificate

## Subdomain Enumeration

to have wordlists for domains https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/

A good tool for automating the process is Altdns (https://github.com/infosec-au/altdns/), which discovers subdomains with names that are permutations of other subdomain names.

Next, find subdomains of subdomains by running the enumeration tools on the previous results

## Service Enumeration

with nmap =====> active scanning (attackers can be detected)
shodan, Censys and Project Sonar =====> passive scanning (no detection)

## Directory Brute-Forcing

with Gobuster or Dirbuster
 ./dirsearch.py -u scanme.nmap.org -e php // -e for extension
 gobuster dir -u target_url -w wordlist // -u to specify the subdomain to brute force
 
 dont visit all the urls one by one, inside use these tools to get screenshots:  EyeWitness (https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness/) or Snapper (https://github.com/dxa4481/Snapper/)
 >> . Keep an eye out for hidden services, such as developer or admin panels, directory listing pages, analytics pages, and pages that look outdated and illmaintained.
 
 ## Spidering the Site
 
 to identify all pages on a site, use ZAP tool  https://www.zaproxy.org/ (learn how on "the BOOK"

## Third-Party Hosting (look on the book)

## GitHub Recon

search for repos, usernames of employees on GitHub and try to look in the issues section, it contains leaks
, look for hardcoded secrets such as API keys, encryption keys, and database passwords
After finding some credentials, use the tool KeyHacks (https://github.com/streaak/keyhacks/) to validate them

Note:
>> Tools like Gitrob and TruffleHog can automate the GitHub recon process. Gitrob (https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob/) locates potentially sensitive 
files pushed to public repositories on GitHub. TruffleHog (https://github.com/
trufflesecurity/truffleHog/) specializes in finding secrets in repositories by conducting regex searches and scanning for high-entropy strings.
